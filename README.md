Sunny is a beautiful weather app using openweather api and a beautiful material interface


The app uses openweatherapi (http://openweathermap.org/) to get weather data.

To use this app , create an account on http://openweathermap.org/  and get your api key.

Add this api key to the end of app's 'gradle.properties' file
as   MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="Your API key here".

Thats it.
